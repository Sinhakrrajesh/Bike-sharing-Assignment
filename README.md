# Project Name : Bike-sharing Assignment
This project is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. This model will help understand the factors influencing bike demand and provide a predictive tool for future demand.

## General Information
- This project is focused on multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes.

    #### Background

    A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.

    A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bike
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands

    #### Business Problem

    The project aims to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

    #### Dataset 

    The dataset is a csv file with the bike-sharing data of BoomBikes. Also a text file having data_dictionary.

    #### Approach

    ##### Step-by-Step Analysis:

    - **Reading, understanding and visualising the data**
    - **Preparing the data for modelling**
    - **Training the model**
    - **Residual analysis**
    - **Predictions and evaluations**

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes are:

- temp (temperature)
- Year
- windspeed
- Season (spring, winter)
- month(November, December)
- weathersit( Light_snowrain , Misty)
